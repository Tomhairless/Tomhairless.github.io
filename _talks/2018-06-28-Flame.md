The research in flame characteristics relies on high-speed cameras. Researchers normally need to spend plenty of time processing the pictures captured by high-speed cameras to analyse the flame by their own hand. This work makes this time-consuming part automatic and creates the potential of embedded an FPGA processing system in the camera to get a real-time observation and analysis for the flame characteristics systems.
